# TypeScript Jasmine Unit Testing

An example TypeScript project with Jasmine unit tests. Utilises Webpack to resolve `require()` and compile TypeScript (google `webpack typescript` for more info). To run tests, clone this repository, run `npm install` in the directory and open `unit-tests.html`. If you want Webpack to recompile the `bundle.js` for you in real time, run `npm run watch`. The unit test code can be found in `src/app.ts`. You might have to install `typings` globally via NPM and run `typings install` if your TypeScript compiler will complain about missing modules or definitions.
